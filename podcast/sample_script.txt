{person1}
so like i had social anxiety [nervous laugh] um yeah like really bad and it was literally just… ordering food or like, walking into a room felt like i was like dying [sighs]

{person2}
yeah no same like i couldn’t even like [pause] i don’t know like i’d go to the grocery store and just like panic about where to stand in line [laughs softly] it’s so dumb but it felt so real

{person1}
yeah like [overlapping] yeah yeah yeah, like your body’s just like— [imitates alarm sound] warning warning everyone’s watching you [laughs quietly]

{person2}
[soft laugh] exactly and like you know nobody actually cares, but your brain’s like [whispers] “they’re literally judging your elbows”

{person1}
[laughs] no literally, like why the fuck would anyone care about my elbows but my brain’s like yeah they care, they care so much [sighs]

{person2}
but okay like [excited tone] i saw this thing online and it was kinda cool? like an app that just gives you like tiny challenges every day

{person1}
what like um [confused laugh] “go outside”

{person2}
[laughs] kinda yeah, like one day it’ll be like “say hi to a stranger” or like “order something without using the app” [pause] it’s like little baby steps to just like… get out of your comfort zone

{person1}
oh wait that’s actually kinda smart like [thinking tone] anxiety training wheels or something

{person2}
yeah like reps for your social life [laughs softly] and i swear it actually helps, like i can just walk in somewhere now and not spiral immediately

{person1}
[murmurs agreeing] mhm, yeah that’s actually sick, like low-key wanna try that

{person2}
[smiling voice] yeah no it’s like, not perfect obviously, but it feels like progress and that’s kinda all i wanted
